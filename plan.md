# To-Do List:

#### Current Setup:

1. #### Tasks:
   ✅ We have three assistants (Triage, Sales, Refunds)  
   ✅ Each assistant has its own specialized tools and instructions  
   ✅ AssistantsEngine handles initialization and deployment  
   ✅ Basic demo loop is working with the engine
   ✅ Basic transfer function structure implemented
   ✅ Basic type definitions for transfers
   ✅ Basic query_docs tools implemented
   ❌ Full integration testing needed

#### Current Issues:

1. #### Type Safety:
   ❌ Unsafe type assertions in toolOutputPromises
   ❌ Promise<unknown>[] vs Promise<ToolCallOutput>[] mismatch
   ❌ Transfer response handling needs proper typing

2. #### Transfer Functions:
   ✅ Functions match the Tool type signature  
   ❌ Context/history handling during transfers needs fixing  
   ✅ Circular reference issues resolved
   ✅ Parameter validation implemented
   ✅ Basic error handling implemented
   ❌ Need to handle transfer responses properly in toolOutputPromises

3. #### Assistant Integration:
   ✅ Properly integrated with OpenAI Assistants API  
   ✅ Tool definitions have proper typing and parameters  
   ✅ Assistant instances properly initialized   
   ❌ Thread management needs improvement
   ❌ Context preservation needs work

## List of Tasks:
- [x] Create three assistants (Triage, Sales, Refunds)
- [x] Create basic transfer function structure
- [x] Implement basic query_docs tools
- [x] Set up basic type definitions
- [x] AssistantsEngine handles initialization and deployment
- [x] Basic demo loop working with the engine

### Fix Transfer Functions:
1. High Priority:
   - [x] Update function signatures to match Tool type
   - [x] Add proper parameter schemas
   - [x] Implement proper error handling
   - [ ] Fix context/history handling
   - [ ] Fix type safety in toolOutputPromises

2. Integration:
   - [x] Update AssistantsEngine to handle transfers properly
   - [ ] Improve thread management
   - [ ] Add context preservation
   - [x] Ensure consistent model usage

3. Testing:
   - [ ] Add unit tests for transfer functions
   - [ ] Add integration tests for assistant transfers
   - [ ] Test error scenarios
   - [ ] Verify context preservation
   - [ ] Add end-to-end test cases

4. Documentation:
   - [ ] Document transfer function usage
   - [ ] Add examples for each transfer scenario
   - [ ] Document error handling procedures
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

### Next Steps:
1. Fix type safety issues in toolOutputPromises
2. Implement proper transfer response handling
3. Complete context/history handling
4. Add full integration tests
