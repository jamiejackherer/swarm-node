# To-Do List:

#### Current Setup:

1. #### Tasks:
   ✅ We have three assistants (Triage, Sales, Refunds)  
   ✅ Each assistant has its own specialized tools and instructions  
   ✅ AssistantsEngine handles initialization and deployment  
   ✅ Basic demo loop is working with the engine


#### Current Issues:

1. #### Transfer Functions:
   ❌ Functions don't properly match the Tool type signature  
   ❌ Context/history handling during transfers needs fixing  
   ❌ Circular reference issues with assistant declarations

2. #### Assistant Integration:
   ❌ Need to properly integrate with OpenAI Assistants API  
   ❌ Tool definitions need proper typing and parameters  
   ❌ Assistant instances need proper initialization   

## List of Tasks:
- [x] Create three assistants (Triage, Sales, Refunds)
